=========================================
Quick Start for RHEL, CentOS, and Rocky 8
=========================================

Install Warewulf and dependencies
=================================

.. code-block:: bash

   $ sudo dnf groupinstall "Development Tools"
   $ sudo dnf install epel-release
   $ sudo dnf install golang tftp-server dhcp-server nfs-utils

   $ sudo systemctl stop firewalld
   $ sudo systemctl disable firewalld

   $ git clone https://github.com/hpng/warewulf.git
   $ cd warewulf
   $ make all
   $ sudo make install

Configure the controller
=========================

Edit the file ``/etc/warewulf/warewulf.conf`` and ensure that you've set the
appropriate configuration paramaters. Here are some of the defaults for reference:

.. code-block:: yaml

   ipaddr: 192.168.1.1
   netmask: 255.255.255.0
   warewulf:
     port: 9873
     secure: true
     update interval: 60
   dhcp:
     enabled: true
     range start: 192.168.1.150
     range end: 192.168.1.200
     template: default
     systemd name: dhcpd
   tftp:
     enabled: true
     tftproot: /var/lib/tftpboot
     systemd name: tftp
   nfs:
     systemd name: nfs-server
     exports:
       - /home
       - /var/warewulf

Configure system services automatically
=======================================

.. code-block:: bash

   $ sudo wwctl configure dhcp # Create the default dhcpd.conf file and start/enable service
   $ sudo wwctl configure tftp # Install the base tftp/PXE boot files and start/enable service
   $ sudo wwctl configure nfs  # Configure the exports and create an fstab in the default system overlay
   $ sudo wwctl configure ssh  # Build the basic ssh keys to be included by the default system overlay


Pull and build the VNFS container and kernel
============================================

This will pull a basic VNFS container from Docker Hub and import the default running
kernel from the controller node and set both in the "default" node profile.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ sudo wwctl container import docker://warewulf/centos-8 centos-8 --setdefault
   $ sudo wwctl kernel import $(uname -r) --setdefault

Set up the default node profile
===============================

The ``--setdefault`` arguments above will automatically set those entries in the default
profile, but if you wanted to set them by hand to something different, you can do the
following:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ sudo wwctl profile set default -K $(uname -r) -C centos-7

Next we set some default networking configurations for the first ethernet device. On
modern Linux distributions, the name of the device is not critical, as it will be setup
according to the HW address. Because all nodes will share the netmask and gateway
configuration, we can set them in the default profile as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ sudo wwctl profile set default --netdev eth0 -M 255.255.255.0 -G 192.168.1.1
   $ sudo wwctl profile list

Add a node and build node specific overlays
===========================================

Adding nodes can be done while setting configurations in one command. Here we are setting
the IP address of ``eth0`` and setting this node to be discoverable, which will then
automatically have the HW address added to the configuration as the node boots.

Node names must be unique. If you have node groups and/or multiple clusters, designate
them using dot notation.

Note that the full node configuration comes from both cascading profiles and node
configurations which always supersede profile configurations.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ sudo wwctl node add n0000.cluster --netdev eth0 -I 192.168.1.100 --discoverable
   $ sudo wwctl node list -a n0000

Warewulf Overlays
=================

There are two types of overlays: system and runtime overlays.

System overlays are provisioned to the node before ``/sbin/init`` is called. This enables us
to prepopulate node configurations with content that is node specific like networking and
service configurations.

Runtime overlays are provisioned after the node has booted and periodically during the
normal runtime of the node. Because these overlays are provisioned at periodic intervals,
they are very useful for content that changes, like users and groups.

Overlays are generated from a template structure that is viewed using the ``wwctl overlay``
commands. Files that end in the ``.ww`` suffix are templates and abide by standard
text/template rules. This supports loops, arrays, variables, and functions making overlays
extremely flexible.

.. note::
   When using the overlay subsystem, system overlays are never shown by default. So when running ``overlay`` commands, you are always looking at runtime overlays unless the ``-s`` option is passed.

All overlays are compiled before being provisioned. This accelerates the provisioning
process because there is less to do when nodes are being managed at scale.

Here are some of the common ``overlay`` commands:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ sudo wwctl overlay list -l
   $ sudo wwctl overlay list -ls
   $ sudo wwctl overlay edit default /etc/hello_world.ww
   $ sudo wwctl overlay build -a

Start the Warewulf daemon
-------------------------

Once the above provisioning images are built, you can check the provisioning "rediness"
and then begin booting nodes.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ sudo wwctl ready
   $ sudo wwctl server start
   $ sudo wwctl server status

Boot your compute node and watch it boot
----------------------------------------
